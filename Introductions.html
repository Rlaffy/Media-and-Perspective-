    <p class="p">  Recently media has been focused heavily on Ukraine and the pressures put by both Russia and Western Nations. 
      This situation however has happened multiple times throughout recent history. 
      The media we consume has a heavy influence on our perspective of situations and can cause for 
      differing opinions on foreign relation between different countries. This information can often cause for strife to form between 
      peoples of different nations. The solutions for this would be to facilitate proper discourse around dissenting perspectives.
