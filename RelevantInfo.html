        There is a variety of relations that are demonstrated in Media. Escpecially within recent times, peoples perspectives 
        are heavily based on what media they consume. Media is heavily 
        based of regional values and often enough people of different 
        locations of the world will have a different perspective. This isnt neccesarily a bad thing in a certain scneraios, 
        but in others it can cause quite a bit of strife. In todays society, we have plenty of ways to relay information 
        across the world. Even within a Nation-State itself many dissenting opinions can happen and media sources can lend itself to bias.
