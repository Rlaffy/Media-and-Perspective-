    <h1>Why It Matters</h1>
    
    <p><b> The reason I find this topic to be important to me is becuase 
        its an often occurence that people simply take in the information that is simply presensted to them. 
        They deccidde to treat said information as true without checking to see if the media they use has a bias 
        or narrative that they want to pursue for the sake of having a wider audience interaction.

        Myside bias is a common type of cognitive bias where people process information in a manner
         biased toward their own prior beliefs, opinions, and attitudes. It occurs when people seek, interpret, 
         and remember evidence to confirm their preexisting beliefs and to
         refute opinions different from their own. For example, people with certain political affiliations
         may selectively tune in news channels that align with their own political views, 
         take the broadcast information as truth, and remember the information over time in spite of new, 
         viewopposing information from other sources. 
         Some researchers consider myside bias to be a subclass of confirmation bias, 
         and some suggest that “myside bias” is a more precise term
         than “confirmation bias” to refer to the tendency of processing information to support one’s
         own position .
