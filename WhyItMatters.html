    <h1>Why It Matters</h1>
    
    <p1><b> The reason I find this topic to be important to me is becuase its an often occurence that people simply take in the information that is simply presensted to them. They decidde to treat said information as true eithput checking to see if the media they use has a bias or narratice that they want to pursue for the sake of having a wider audience interaction.
